# CMS

## Install

```js

  git clone git@github.com:gatortim50/cms.git

  cd cms

  yarn install && yarn start

```

## Code Challenge Instructions:

Write a Node script (v8 preferred) that transforms data.json into data-transformed.json.
There is no need for any UI, it’s fine to directly read in data.json from the current directory.

### Restrictions:

•	No for or for…of loops
•	No let or var
